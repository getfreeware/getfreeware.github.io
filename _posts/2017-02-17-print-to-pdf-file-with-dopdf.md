I had a PDF file which only allows me to print to xps file (I don&#8217;t know why)

There are a lot of free software which will install a PDF printer on your computer and you can then print any file to PDF one.

The one I picked is doPDF which is ranked top 3 in google search result when I search. After the installation, you will find another option in the printer list &#8211; &#8216;doPDF x&#8217; (where x is the version of the application I reckon, I am using 8).

Now I can print the xps file to PDF file. (For some reason the original PDF still wouldn&#8217;t allow me to print to PDF directly)
